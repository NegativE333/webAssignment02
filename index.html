      <p>Project Centric Learning (PCL) lets students pick projects in areas like healthcare, agriculture, and more. They learn by solving real-world problems, taking online courses, and getting guidance from teachers. PCL helps students gain practical skills for success in a project-based world, with a focus on hands-on learning and mentorship from teachers.</p>

        <h3>Design Thinking (DT)</h3>
        <h4>
          Course Relevance
        </h4>
        <p>DT focuses on teaching students about research, paper publication, and patent filing. It helps them understand the importance of research, distinguish terms related to it, and apply the methodology of publication. The course also covers topics like intellectual property rights, ethics in research, and entrepreneurship. By the end, students are expected to publish a paper or file a patent, gaining practical knowledge and skills in these areas.</p>

        <p>
          A course project is an integral part of academic learning, offering students the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. These projects are designed to enhance practical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities within a specific subject area. Often collaborative in nature, course projects foster teamwork, communication, and time management.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of a course project can vary, ranging from software development and research studies to design prototypes and business plans. Students engage in hands-on experiences, allowing them to delve deeper into the subject matter and gain a comprehensive understanding of the concepts covered in the course.

          Software project development comes under the category of project based learning (PBL). PBL is an instructional approach designed to give students the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the real world by using domain specific language technologies. PBL is "learning by doing."
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, if students are prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. Project based learning will also redefine the role of teacher as mentor in the learning process.The PBL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question, challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve. It brings students not only to know, understand and remember rather it takes them to analyze, design and apply categories of Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy.
